# Added Preferences 

## Tested 
- Abigail likes jack-o-lanterns (secret note #1). 
- Abigail likes fairy stones (preference for minerals + purple). 
- Shane likes chicken statues.
- Jas loves ice cream instead of liking it.
- Leah likes marble and has custom dialogue for receiving it as a gift. 
- Lewis loves blueberries during summer (as it is fresh, in reference to his summer sundays dialogue), and likes them during other seasons.

## In Progress 
- Add config options (true/false at first)

### To-Do  
- Shane likes Joja cola after his 6-heart event. 
- Shane has custom dialogue for gifted beer after his 6-heart event. It is no longer a loved gift. (inspired by other mods)
- If the strange bun recipe has been sent by shane in the mail, he will like strange buns after. 
- Harvey reacts neutrally the first time glasses are gifted, and has special dialogue expressing confusion. Later times, the gift is disliked and he mentions that he has his glasses on him right now. 
- Add update keys in manifest.json? 
- Make a proper readme for the parent folder 
- Make a proper readme for this folder 
- Continue adding log names 

## Notes for myself 
- Lewis gift preferences have been hardcoded in because I couldn't figure out how to move a preference from like to love depending on season. 
- Changes to configs are applied whenever the in-game clock changes. (couldn't find a way to update when the token changes and this was the most frequent option)
- Most current issue: trying to get mod on/off working, as well as abigail's specific preferences (make the settings actually change things! Currently abigail dislikes fairy stones and likes jack-o-lanterns no matter what options are selected)
  - Then get it to update when config is changed during an in-game day
