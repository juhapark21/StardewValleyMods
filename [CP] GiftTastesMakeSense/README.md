## Untested 

### To-Do  
- Shane likes Joja cola after his 6-heart event. 
- Shane has custom dialogue for gifted beer after his 6-heart event. It is no longer a loved gift. (inspired by other mods)
- Add optional toggles for each config. 
- If the strange bun recipe has been sent by shane in the mail, he will like strange buns after. 
- Harvey reacts neutrally the first time glasses are gifted, and has special dialogue expressing confusion. Later times, the gift is disliked and he mentions that he has his glasses on him right now. 
- Add update keys in manifest.json? 
- Make a proper readme for the parent folder 
- Make a proper readme for this folder
