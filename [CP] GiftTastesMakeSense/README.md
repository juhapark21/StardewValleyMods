# Added Preferences 

## Tested 
- Abigail likes jack-o-lanterns (secret note #1). 
- Abigail likes fairy stones (preference for minerals + purple). 
- Shane likes chicken statues.
- Jas loves ice cream instead of liking it.
- Leah likes marble and has custom dialogue for receiving it as a gift. 
- Lewis loves blueberries during summer (as it is fresh, in reference to his summer sundays dialogue), and likes them during other seasons.
- Shane likes Joja cola after his 6-heart event. 

## In Progress 

### To-Do  
- Shane has custom dialogue for gifted beer after his 6-heart event. It is no longer a loved gift. (inspired by other mods)
- Add update keys in manifest.json? 
- Make a proper readme for the parent folder 
- Make a proper readme for this folder 

## Notes for myself 
- Lewis gift preferences have been hardcoded in because I couldn't figure out how to move a preference from like to love depending on season.
